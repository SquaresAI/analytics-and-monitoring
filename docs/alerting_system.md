# Alerting System Documentation

## Overview
The alerting system in Squares AI is designed to notify administrators and users about critical events, such as model degradation, infrastructure issues, or anomalies in data processing pipelines. This system ensures high availability, reliability, and timely responses to incidents.

### Key Features
1. **Real-Time Notifications**: Alerts triggered in real-time based on predefined thresholds.
2. **Multi-Channel Support**: Notifications sent via email, Slack, and webhook integrations.
3. **Customizable Rules**: Users can define alerting thresholds and conditions specific to their needs.
4. **Integration with Monitoring Tools**: Compatible with tools like Prometheus and Grafana.

## Architecture
The alerting system consists of the following components:
- **Event Processor**: Detects anomalies and triggers alerts.
- **Notification Engine**: Sends notifications to specified channels.
- **Rule Configurator**: Allows users to set thresholds and alert conditions.

## Implementation Details
1. **Threshold-Based Alerts**: 
    ```python
    def check_threshold(metric_value, threshold):
        if metric_value > threshold:
            trigger_alert(metric_value)
    ```

2. **Integration with Prometheus**:
    ```yaml
    groups:
      - name: Squares AI Alerts
        rules:
          - alert: HighLatency
            expr: request_duration_seconds{job="api"} > 0.5
            for: 1m
            labels:
              severity: critical
            annotations:
              summary: "High latency detected in API response"
    ```

## Setup Guide
1. Define alerting rules in the `alerts.yaml` configuration file.
2. Deploy the alerting system using Docker:
    ```bash
    docker-compose up -d alerting
    ```
3. Test the system by triggering a sample alert.

## Maintenance
- Regularly update alerting rules to reflect operational changes.
- Monitor alert delivery success rates and investigate failures promptly.
