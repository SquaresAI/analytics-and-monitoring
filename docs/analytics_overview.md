# Analytics Overview

## Purpose
The analytics module in Squares AI provides insights into model performance, system metrics and user behavior. It enables stakeholders to make data-driven decisions, optimize workflows and ensure system reliability.

### Core Components
1. **Data Aggregator**: Collects metrics from various sources, such as GPUs, models and user interactions.
2. **Metrics Dashboard**: Visualizes metrics in real-time using tools like Grafana.
3. **Historical Analysis**: Stores and processes historical data for trend analysis.

## Supported Metrics
- **Model Metrics**: Accuracy, latency, throughput and error rates.
- **System Metrics**: GPU utilization, memory usage and node availability.
- **User Metrics**: API call frequency, dataset upload trends, and marketplace activity.

## How It Works
1. **Data Collection**: Metrics are collected using Prometheus exporters deployed on all nodes.
2. **Data Processing**: Aggregated metrics are processed and stored in a time-series database.
3. **Visualization**: Dashboards are generated dynamically based on user-defined parameters.

## Deployment Steps
1. Install the analytics module dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install prometheus_client grafana-api
    ```
2. Configure Prometheus to scrape metrics:
    ```yaml
    scrape_configs:
      - job_name: 'analytics'
        static_configs:
          - targets: ['localhost:9090']
    ```
3. Launch the Grafana dashboard:
    ```bash
    docker run -d --name=grafana -p 3000:3000 grafana/grafana
    ```
