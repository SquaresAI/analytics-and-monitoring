# Dashboard Guidelines

## Purpose
Dashboards in Squares AI serve as a single source of truth for monitoring and analyzing system performance, user behavior and model efficiency. This document outlines the best practices for designing and using dashboards.

## Design Principles
1. **Clarity**: Ensure that each dashboard is easy to understand and actionable.
2. **Consistency**: Use consistent layouts, colors, and naming conventions.
3. **Focus**: Limit each dashboard to 5-7 key metrics to avoid information overload.

## Recommended Layouts
1. **System Performance Dashboard**:
   - GPU Utilization
   - Memory Usage
   - Node Availability

2. **Model Performance Dashboard**:
   - Model Accuracy
   - Prediction Latency
   - Error Rates

3. **User Behavior Dashboard**:
   - API Usage Trends
   - Dataset Upload Rates
   - Marketplace Transactions

## Configuration Tips
1. Use Prometheus as the data source for Grafana.
2. Group related metrics together in panels for better visualization.
3. Enable alert annotations to highlight critical events.

## Sample JSON Configuration
```json
{
  "dashboard": {
    "panels": [
      {
        "type": "graph",
        "title": "GPU Utilization",
        "targets": [
          {
            "expr": "gpu_utilization{job='nodes'}",
            "format": "time_series"
          }
        ]
      },
      {
        "type": "stat",
        "title": "Node Availability",
        "targets": [
          {
            "expr": "up{job='nodes'}",
            "format": "time_series"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```
